QB Web Portal
-- 

Created by Kevin Jones for MEP Brothers Ltd.
Using QT for windows-only deployment. 

-- 

Summary: The QB Web Portal is, at this point, a console-based application to 
transfer limited data to a web-based database to be used for customer viewing 
online. This is designed for inventory and limited order information for 
confirmation and tracking of orders and estiamtes. 

--

Project includes: This project is designed to use the XML-based connection API
designed by Intuit Quickbooks to transfer data from the local file to online
via MySQL. Data is not stored locally, only online. 

-- 

Status and To-Do: This project is considered to be in active development, and 
therefore its currently usability is inconsistent, though the current build should
be stable for basic usage. This application requires an active license of 
Intuit Quickbooks to use, as well as credentials for an online MySQL Database.

To Do: This project is actively in development. There is a great deal of work 
needed to bring this project to completion. Future plans include a simple user 
interface, and making the program designed to be "set and forget"
